# Sufficient-Statistic-Based-Suboptimal-Strategies-in-Infinite-Horizon-Two-Player-Zero-Sum Stochastic Bayesian game
This repository contains all the codes requires to compute sufficient statistic based suboptimal strategies in an infinite horizon two-player zero-sum stochastic Bayesian game:
### Problem Setup:
Jamming problems in underwater acoustic sensor networks can be modeled as Two-Player-Zero-Sum Stochastic game for infinite horizon where both players are partially informed. There are four sensors <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4)"> which are referred as Player 1 and one jammer which is referred as Player 2. Sensors' goal is to transmit data using available two channels  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1">=[10 25] kHz and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_2">=[25 40] kHz. Two sensors can work at a time and each channel can be used by one sensor. Jammer's goal is to block this data transfer. The distance from sink node to sensor <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_1,s_2,s_3"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_4"> are 1 km, 5 km, 1 km and 5 km, respectively. So, the states of player 1 are [1,1] (k=1), [1,5] (k=2) and [5,5] (k=3). Here, [5,1] and [1,5] are considered as the same state. The distance of the jammer from sink nodes are 0.5 km and 2 km. So, player 2 has 2 states [0.5] (l=1) and [2] (l=2). The initial state probabilities of player 1 and player 2 are p=[0.5 0.3 0.2] and q=[0.5 0.5]. The game value is the security level of the players.

The sensors coordinate with each other to use the channels so that they can maximize the data transmission. Channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1"> is more effective for the sensors which are far away and channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_2"> is better for the sensors close by. Though the sensors and the jammer do not know each other's position, the jammer can observe whether a channel is used by a far away sensor or a close by sensor. For each time period, the jammer can only generate noises in one channel and sensors are able to detect it. If the sensor state is [1,1], the active sensors are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_1"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_3">. The feasible actions are <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_1"> using channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1"> while <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_3"> using channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_2"> (action 1), and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_1"> using channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_2"> while <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_3"> using channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1"> (action 2). Similar for state [1,5] and [5,5]. The jammer's action for blocking channel <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_1"> is action 1 and blocking <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_2"> is action 2. 

As this is a stochastic game there is transition matrices for both player's state. The total channel capacity matrix (Payoff matrix), given sensors' type k and jammer's type l are as follows.

For example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G_{k_t=2, l_t=2}(a_t=1, b_t=1)=24.89">. Transition matrix for sensor's state (P) is

For example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_{a=1,b=1}(k_{t-1}=2,k_t=2)=0.4">. The transition matrix of the jammer (Q) is

For example, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Q_{a=1,b=1}(l_{t-1}=2,l_t=2)=0.5">.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to design a sufficient statistic based algorithm to find the optimal stratgies of the players for infinite horizon game.

### Solution (Receding horizon method)
In primal game the sufficient statistics are not fully accessible to the player. Thats why dual game is introduced where the belief and inital vector payoff are fully accessible to the player. But directly using the LP of dual game for infinite horzion game is not possible. Thats why we use receding horizon method to find the optimal strategy of the players. In this method we find the optimal strategy for one window and take action for the 1st stage of that window. Then move the window 1 step ahead and repeat the process.
